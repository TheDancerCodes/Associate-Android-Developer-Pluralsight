[1] Building a Simple App:

(a)Adding Some Java Code:

-> When a user taps on the FAB, we want to double the value displayed in the TextView.

-> Create a helper class/ worker class that handles receiving a number and giving us back double.

(b) Add Code to create the UX:

-> We want to call the function we created for our worker class every time we click the FAB.

Functionality:

-> Get reference to TextView & get its current value as a string,
-> Convert it to an integer,
-> Call the function doubleTheValue from MyWorker class,
-> Put that value in a newValue variable,
-> Write it back to the TextView converted as a string.
